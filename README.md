# EarlyLate_RNA_eQTL

A code repository for custom scripts used in the analyses described in our manuscript "**Early and late RNA eQTL are driven by different genetic mechanisms**" (Sakaue et al.)

### Table of Contents

- 01_eQTL: cis-eQTL mapping
- 02_finemap_coloc: finemapping and colocalization analyses between n-eQTL and c-eQTL
- 03_diff_enrich: differential enrichment analyses to characterize genomic annotations preferentially enriched for statistically fine-mapped variants in either n-eQTL or c-eQTL
- 04_disease_coloc: colocalization analyses between eQTL and disease GWAS (neuropsychiatric diseases)
